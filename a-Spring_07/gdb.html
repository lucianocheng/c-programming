<h1>ESE 113/116: GDB</h1>
<p><strong>The purpose of this is to demonstrate GDB, the GNU debugger.</strong></p>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Explain the purposes of the GNU debugger</li>
  <li>Use GDB to narrow down a segmentation fault in a simple program</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reference:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/">The GNU Debugger: Complete 
    Documentation </a></li>
</ul>
<h2>What is GDB?</h2>
<p>GDB stands for<strong> The GNU Debugger</strong>. GDB is a unix terminal debugger, 
  which can execute your program in a sandbox and allow you to analyze it during 
  runtime. GDB has no GUI, but is very simple to use and in some cases can cut 
  your debugging time from hours to minutes.</p>
<h2>Example: A simple segmentation fault</h2>
<p><font size="4">Downloading and running the program sans-gdb:</font></p>
<p>In this example, we will find the segmentation fault in a small program, segfault.c. 
  <br />
  To start, download <a href="./segfault.c">segfault.c</a> and open it up in an 
  editor such as vi or emacs.</p>
<p>As you can see, the segfault.c program creates a char array with <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Hello</font> 
  stored in it. The main function then calls <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">findA()</font>, 
  which attempts to find the first instance in the string where two 'A' characters 
  occur in a row. </p>
<p>Now, if you compile segfault.c</p>
<pre>	user@plus:~&gt; gcc -Wall -o segfault segfault.c</pre>
<p> and run it at the prompt, you will get the following:</p>
<pre>	user@plus:~&gt; ./segfault<br />	Calling findNull, will seg fault now<br />	Segmentation fault<br />	user@plus:~&gt;</pre>
As you can see, the program <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">segfault</font> 
has crashed. This occurs because <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Hello</font> 
does not have two consecutive A's. After <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">findA()</font> 
does not find two consecutive A's <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">in 
</font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Hello</font>, it continues reading 
past the end of the array into system memory, causing a segmentation fault. 
<p><font size="4">Engaging the debugger:</font></p>
<p>We will now use gdb to discover where this segmentation fault occurs in the 
  code</p>
<p>The first step in using gdb is to compile your program with debugger tags. 
  Compiling with debugger tags embeds information about your source code into 
  your executable file. The debugger can then use this to pinpoint where a given 
  error occurs</p>
<p>To add debug tags, add the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">-g</font> 
  flag to the compile line.</p> 
<pre>	user@plus:~&gt; gcc <strong>-g</strong> -Wall -o segfault segfault.c
</pre>
<p>Your program is now compiled with debug tags. Next, start GDB with your program:</p>
<pre>	user@plus:~&gt; gdb ./segfault</p>
</pre>
<p>After starting the debugger, you will see the following, which means GDB has 
  launched successfully:</p>
<pre>	GNU gdb 6.4
	Copyright 2005 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are
	welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.
	Type &quot;show copying&quot; to see the conditions.<br />	There is absolutely no warranty for GDB. Type &quot;show warranty&quot; for 
	details.<br />
	This GDB was configured as &quot;i586-suse-linux&quot;...Using host libthread_db 
	library &quot;/lib/libthread_db.so.1&quot;.
	(gdb)</p></pre>
<p>GDB then presents you with a prompt. This prompt is where you input all gdb 
  commands. For right now, we will simply run the program and see what it does. 
  However, a list of extended GDB commands and their functions can be found <a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_4.html#SEC14">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you wanted to run this program with arguments, you would run the program 
  in the debugger by typing <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">run</font> 
  followed by the arguments that would normally follow the program name at the 
  command prompt. <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">segfault</font> does 
  not take arguments, so in this case to run the program, simply type <strong>run</strong> 
  at the prompt: </p> 
<pre>	(gdb) run</pre>
<p>Gdb then starts the program:</p>
<pre>	Starting program: /mnt/castor/seas_home/u/user/segfault</pre>
<p>The program then runs, crashing at a segmentation fault:</p>
<pre>	Calling findNull, will seg fault now
		Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  		0x08048467 in findA (newArray=0xbfffeace &quot;Hello\n&eth;&ecirc;&yuml;&iquest;H&euml;&yuml;&iquest;|&egrave;&ecirc;&middot;&agrave;\f&quot;)
  		at segfault.c:34
  		34 while(newArray[i] != 'A' || newArray[i+1] != 'A'){</pre>
After the program crashes, GDB takes over. GDB then uses the tag information embedded 
in the executable to give you information about what caused the program to crash. 
In this example, GDB tells us: 
<ul>
  <li>The type of error: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>Segmentation 
    Fault</strong></font></li>
  <li>The function where the error occurred: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>findA</strong></font></li>
  <li>The variable that was used incorrectly: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>newArray</strong></font></li>
  <li>The file the error was caused in: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>segfault.c</strong></font></li>
  <li>The line number the error occurred at: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>line 
    34</strong></font></li>
  <li>The line of code that caused the error, a <strong><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> 
    while loop</font></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can now use the above information to fix the error in your source code.<br />
  <br />
  Another simple gdb command is <strong>where</strong>. <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Where</font> 
  will give you a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation">stack 
  dump</a>, which means it will give you the calling function of the code that 
  crashed, then the function that called that function, and recurse upwards through 
  the functions until you reach the main function. This can be helpful if your 
  code has significant function depth. In this case, after the program crashes, 
  the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">where</font> command will return 
  the following. 
<pre>	(gdb) where<br />	#0 0x08048467 in findA (newArray=0xbfffeace &quot;Hello\n&eth;&ecirc;&yuml;&iquest;H&euml;&yuml;&iquest;|&egrave;&ecirc;&middot;&agrave;\f&quot;)
	at segfault.c:34
	#1 0x08048434 in main () at segfault.c:25</pre>
This dump means that <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">findA</font> was 
the function that crashed, and that <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">findA</font> 
was called by <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">main</font>.<br />
Finally, to quit GDB, type <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">quit</font> 
at the command line, then type <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">y</font> 
when it asks to confirm: 
<pre>	(gdb) quit<br />	The program is running. Exit anyway? (y or n) y
</pre>
<p>You can now fix your code, and repeat the process to see if a segmentation 
  fault still occurs.</p>

<p>This example is just a small subset of GDB's capabilities. For additional GDB 
  commands and instructions, see the <a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html">GDB 
  documentation</a>.</p>
<p>There is another debugger called <strong>ddd</strong> that is the GUI version 
  of GDB. Learning and using ddd is not necessary for the small programs you will 
  be writing this course. However, the documentation for ddd can be found <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ddd/html_mono/ddd.html">here</a>.</p>
