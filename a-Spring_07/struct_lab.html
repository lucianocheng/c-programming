<h1>ESE 113/116 Lab: Struct Exercises</h1>
<p>The purpose of this lab is to create a simple bowling database using structs 
  and arrays.</p>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Define, declare and initialize C Structs</li>
  <li>Access and modify member variables in structures</li>
  <li>Use structures to organize data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reference</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecse1xx/projects/CandC%2B%2B/Structs/GettingStarted/">C 
  Structs: Background</a></p>

<h2>Exercise: Bowling Database</h2>
<p>Download and complete <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecse1xx/projects/CandC%2B%2B/Structs/GettingStarted/bowling.c">bowling.c</a>. 
  Extended instructions for completion are included in comments in the file. Once 
  completed, this program will take in data for a bowling database as arguments, 
  store it in an array of structs, and printf out the database when done.</p>
<p>Specific sections of code have been left blank for you to fill in. See the 
  instructions in the file.</p>
<p>An example run might look like this (to demonstrate functionality, not any required formatting of output):</p>
<code class="block"></code>
<pre>$ ./bowling Leela 10 20

name: Leela, average: 10, shoe size: 20.000000
</pre>
