Lectures

Study Notes / Slides
====================
- Study notes are ordered and grouped by topic.


Exercises
=========
- Exercises are grouped by exercise.
- Each exercise contains instructions




Documents and projects from co-lecturing ESE116 / Into to C Programming at the University of Pennsylvania.

Currently work is ordered by year, which means a lot of duplication.  Eventually I'm going to clean this up so there's a 'canonical' example of each exercise.
