<h3>Purposes of this assignment:</h3>
To practice and learn:
<ul>
  <li>Working with char[][] arrays and char[] arrays</li>
  <li>Using the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstring/">string.h</a> library and <a href="http://www.hmug.org/man/3/getchar.php">getchar()</a></li>
  <li>Parsing and tokenizing  user input </li>
  <li>Constructing strings, and the subtleties involved with NULL termination </li>

  <li>We highly recommend that you test your program in the lab or on the Eniac server before turning it in.
    <ul>
        <li>There can sometimes be differences between your home setup and the lab / Eniac cluster </li>
      <li>These can cause errors in your code while grading. </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Do not modify tokenizer.h or tokenizer_main.c for your program
    <ul>
        <li>We will be using the given versions when we grade your code</li>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>When writing pieces of software that deal with user input, a tokenizer is a function designed to take user input and cut it up into pieces in order to be parsed. A string tokenizer literally cuts a input string up into smaller strings called &quot;tokens&quot;, which can then be parsed as commands.</p>
<p>In this assignment you will be creating a tokenizer. The tokenizer will read input from STDIN using <a href="http://www.hmug.org/man/3/getchar.php">getchar()</a>. While reading, it will look for spaces and newlines and create new &quot;token&quot; words based on their separation with this whitespace. These token words will be stored in an array of strings (char[][]). After the tokenizer terminates on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file">EOF (end of file)</a> character, you will write a function to sort the tokens alpha-numerically and delete duplicates. </p>
<p>There are two functions you will be writing, get_word() and sort_and_delete_duplicates() </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>get_word()</strong> will pull a single word (a &quot;token&quot;) from STANDARD IN
    <ul>
      <li>The main() function will call get_word until a EOF is reached</li>
      <li>get_word()'s first argument is char array where the &quot;token&quot; string is to be written. The second argument is the size of this array. The function get_word returns different constants based on whether      
        <ul>
          <li>The parser hit a EOF before reading a word &quot;token&quot; </li>
          <li>The parser hit a EOF immediately after reading a word &quot;token&quot; </li>
          <li>The parser read a word with no EOF </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Read the C file for the detailed description.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>sort_and_delete_duplicates()</strong> will sort the tokens in place and delete duplicate tokens
    <ul>
      <li>sort_and_delete_duplicates() will be passed a array of strings, a char[][]</li>
      <li>sort_and_delete_duplicates() will then sort the words <a href="http://www.cdrummond.qc.ca/cegep/informat/Professeurs/Alain/files/ascii.htm">ASCII</a>-alphanumerically using <a href="http://www.hmug.org/man/3/strcmp.php">strcmp()</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubblesort</a> is recommended, however you can use any sorting algorithm you like as long as it follows<br>
        the parameters of the assignment and <strong>does not use malloc()
      </strong>or dynamic memory allocation</li>
      <li>Read the C file for the detailed description. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The constants mentioned in the program specs can be found in tokenizer.h</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Important Notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Please remember that for this assignment, you are <strong>not allowed to use malloc()</strong> in any of the functions you write, or any functions that use any sort of dynamic memory allocation.</li>
  <li>For those of you lucky enough to be taking <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cse381/">CIS 381</a>, <strong>it is not ok </strong>to copy / paste the supplied shell tokenizer code into this homework.
    <ul>
      <li>We will be checking for this and things similar. </li>
      <li>Trust me, it's easier just to write your own. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>You are not allowed to use qsort()</strong>, or any of the sorting functions provided in stdlib. You must implement the sorting yourself. </li>
  <li>Please re-read the string.h slides before you start, and try to use the strings.h library as much as possible.
    <ul>
      <li>If strings.h is used properly, the sorter can be written in under 15 lines.<br>
        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This homework assignment should be <strong>done alone</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>We will be comparing your homeworks to make sure this occurs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Help is available via the bulletin board, office hours, and during the optional lab.
    <ul>
      <li>TA's are also often available  after class on Tuesday.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Please be respectful of the TAs' time and refrain from emailing them individually.
