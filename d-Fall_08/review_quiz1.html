<h3>Quiz Material Overview: </h3>
<ul>
  <li><span class="style1">Unix shell &amp; Terminal: </span> 
    <ul>
      <li>People traditionally communicate with unix via a program called a &quot;shell&quot;. Learn it. Love it. </li>
      <li>The shell runs on top of the unix &quot;kernel&quot; (the core part of the operating system)
        <ul>
          <li>It takes input from a terminal keyboard. It launches and controls commands and programs</li>
          <li>The one we typically use is called bash (&quot;born again shell&quot;). It's a direct descendent of the original &quot;sh&quot; shell. Other examples are csh, ksh, tsh, ...</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Basic intuitive  commands: </strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Commands that do what they say: <strong>date, whoami, hostname, pin</strong>g</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Unix file system concepts </strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>tree, root, node, directory
        <ul>
          <li>Unix File system is shaped like an upside-down tree. The root node is the base of the 
            tree. All other files / directories are descendents of the root</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>current working directory</li>
         <ul>
         <li>A person who logs on to a unix system always has a current location in the file system (originally, their home directory) which can be changed with the cd command</li>
         </ul>
      <li>Absolute (Full) vs Relative pathnames
        <ul>
          <li>An absolute pathname always start with &quot;/&quot;, the root directory (e.g. /usr/lib, /etc, /, /home/h/hacker)</li>
          <li>Relative pathnames never start with &quot;/&quot;</li>
          <ul>
            <li>&quot;..&quot; is the parent of the directory. 
              <ul>
                <li>For example, /home1/l is the same thing as /home1/l/lcheng/..</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>&quot;.&quot; is the current directory 
              <ul>
                <li>For example, /home1/l/lcheng is the same thing as /home1/l/lcheng/.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>&quot;~&quot; is your home directory</li>
            <li>&quot;~max&quot; is Max's home directory </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>File ownership, Permissions 
        <ul>
          <li>User, Group, Other each have their own Read, Write and Execute permissions. 
            9 permissions total</li>
          <li>When using ls -l, the first character in the permissions column 
            is a &quot;d&quot; if it is a directory, and is a &quot;-&quot; if 
            it is not 
            <ul>
              <li>Example, &quot;drwxr-xr--&quot; means the file is a directory, 
                with read/write/execute (rwx) true for the user, read/execute 
                (r-x) true for it's group, and read (r--) true for others.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Every user has a primary group. Every file has a group. When a file 
            or directory is created, it's group is set to be the primary group 
            of the user that created it. This group can be seen by using ls with 
            the -l option. To read more about groups, see this <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Erc/help/faq/permissions.html">tutorial</a>. (The groups on eniac are such that every user has their own group, other systems might set up groups such as &quot;student&quot; or &quot;faculty&quot;)</li>
          <li>Meaning of Permissions for &quot;regular files&quot; (non-directories)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>read permission: can see contents of the file using cat, more, or an editor such as emacs, vi, etc.</li>
                <li>write permission: can change contents of the file (e.g. with an editor like emacs, pico, or vi)</li>
                <li>execute permission: can run the file as a program (e.g. a file that contains a perl/php script or a compiled C program)</li>
              </ul>
          <li>Meaning of Permissions for directories (these may seem counter - intuitive at first glance) :
            <ul>
              <li>Read permission:
                <ul>
                  <li> ... means you can see the names of the files in that directory using 'ls'</li>
                  <li>... does NOT mean you  can change your working directory (cd) to that directory: this is the EXECUTE permission </li>
                  <li>... does NOT allow you to access files in the directory (EXECUTE permission is needed)</li>
                  <li>... does NOT mean you can read the metadata (owner, group etc) of those files using 'ls -l': This requires the EXECUTE permission
                    <ul>
                      <li>NOTE: the above statements are  true even if the files inside that directory have all read / write 
                      / execute permissions turned on.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Execute permission:
                <ul>
                  <li> ... means you can &quot;cd&quot; to that directory.
                    <ul>
                      <li>You can read or write any file inside that directory, assuming 
                        that the file's permissions allow you to do so.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>... does NOT mean you can delete, move, or rename any files within that 
                  directory, no matter the permissions of the file: this is the WRITE permission </li>
                  <li>... does NOT mean you can list the files in that directory: this is the READ permission </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Write permission:
                <ul>
                  <li> ... means you can modify filenames in the directory, 
                      delete files in the directory, or add files in the directory.                    
                    <ul>
                      <li> However, this is not very useful unless you can first read the 
                          directory with the &quot;read&quot; permission, or open the directory 
                        with &quot;execute&quot; permission.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Wildcard Usage 
        / Basic regular expressions
        <ul>
          <li>* means any number of characters as a wildcard. 
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;ls *.c&quot; will list every file in the current working 
                directory that ends in &quot;.c&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          <li>? means a single character wildcard 
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;ls h?.txt&quot; will list every file in the cwd that starts 
                with an h, has any character single character following that, 
                then ends in &quot;.txt&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>[] means a single character wildcard, where the wildcard can only 
            be the characters inside the [] 
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;ls h[io].txt&quot; will list every file in the cwd that 
                starts with an 'h', has either an 'i' or an 'o', then ends with 
                a &quot;.txt&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>cd - Change Directory: Changes the working directory 
          <ul>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>more - Opens up a file for reading (not editing).
          Traditionally, 'more' only allowed for moving down a file
          , however modern implementations allow both upwards and downwards scrolling
          <ul>
            <li>USAGE: more &lt;file&gt;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>less - Opens up a file for reading (not editing). Allows for moving up and down a file.
          <ul>
            <li>USAGE: less &lt;file&gt;</li>

        </li>
        <li>grep - Used to search for patterns in the text inside files. 
          <ul>
            <li>USAGE: grep &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;files&gt;</li>
            <li>Note, this is not used to search for files of a certain name. 
              The &quot;find&quot; command does that.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>cp - Copy a file.

              directory</li>
            <li>Renaming a file simply means changing the destination name: 
              <ul>
                <li>&quot;mv hello.txt ../goodbye.txt&quot; moves &quot;hello.txt&quot; 
                  to it's parent directory, and renames it &quot;goodbye.txt&quot;</li>
                <li>mv by default WILL NOT make a nonexistent directory to move 
                  a file into 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Example: &quot;mv hello.txt ./html/hello.txt&quot; will 
                      produce an error if the directory &quot;html&quot; does 
                      not exist</li>

                  group read and write permissions);
                  <ul>
                    <li>In the example above, the 'other' permissions would remain as they were, whereas the group and user permissions would get wiped and set as requested. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
