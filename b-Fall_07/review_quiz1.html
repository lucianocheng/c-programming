<h3>General Material on the Quiz</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unix shell - using the command line and the terminal </strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>The UNIX terminal is the basis of all UNIX interaction. Learn it. Love 
        it. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Common unix commands: </strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>date, whoami, hostname, ping...</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Unix file system concepts </strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>tree, root, node, directory 
        <ul>
          <li>Unix File system is shaped like a tree. Root is the base of the 
            tree, all other files / directories spring from the root</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Absolute (Full) vs Relative pathnames 
        <ul>
          <li>Absolute pathnames always start with &quot;/&quot;, and begin at 
            the root </li>
          <li>Relative pathnames never start with &quot;/&quot;, and begin at 
            the current working directory</li>
          <li>&quot;..&quot; is the parent of the directory. 
            <ul>
              <li>For example, /home1/l is the same thing as /home1/l/lcheng/..</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&quot;.&quot; is the current directory 
            <ul>
              <li>For example, /home1/l/lcheng is the same thing as /home1/l/lcheng/.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&quot;~&quot; is your home directory</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Current working directory 
        <ul>
          <li>The directory where all relative commands and pathnames are &quot;based&quot; 
            from. Used for relative paths.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>File ownership, Permissions 
        <ul>
          <li>User, Group, Other each have their own Read, Write and Execute permissions. 
            9 permissions total</li>
          <li>When using ls -l, the first character in the permissions column 
            is a &quot;d&quot; if it is a directory, and is a &quot;-&quot; if 
            it is not 
            <ul>
              <li>Example, &quot;drwxr-xr--&quot; means the file is a directory, 
                with read/write/execute (rwx) true for the user, read/execute 
                (r-x) true for it's group, and read (r--) true for others.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Every user has a primary group. Every file has a group. When a file 
            or directory is created, it's group is set to be the primary group 
            of the user that created it. This group can be seen by using ls with 
            the -l option. To read more about groups, see this <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Erc/help/faq/permissions.html">tutorial</a>.</li>
          <li>For directories: 
            <ul>
              <li>Read permission means you can see the files inside that directory, 
                but you cannot change the directory OR open any files within that 
                directory OR read the metadata (owner, etc) of those files. This 
                is true even if the files inside that directory have read / write 
                / execute permissions turned on. 
                <ul>
                  <li>This also inherently means you cannot &quot;cd&quot; into 
                    such a directory</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Execute permission means you can &quot;cd&quot; to that directory. 
                You can read or write to any file inside that directory, assuming 
                that the file's permissions allow you to do so. 
                <ul>
                  <li>You CANNOT, delete, move, or rename any files within that 
                    directory, no matter the permissions of the file, unless the 
                    &quot;write&quot; permission is also set for the directory.</li>
                  <li>You also CANNOT list the files in that directory, unless 
                    the &quot;read&quot; permission for that directory is also 
                    set.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Write permission means you can modify filenames in the directory, 
                delete files in the directory, or add files in the directory. 
                However, this is not very useful unless you can first read the 
                directory with the &quot;read&quot; permission, or open the directory 
                with &quot;execute&quot; permission.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Wildcard Usage 
        <ul>
          <li>* means any number of characters as a wildcard. 
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;ls *.c&quot; will list every file in the current working 
                directory that ends in &quot;.c&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          <li>? means a single character wildcard 
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;ls h?.txt&quot; will list every file in the cwd that starts 
                with an h, has any character single character following that, 
                then ends in &quot;.txt&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>[] means a single character wildcard, where the wildcard can only 
            be the characters inside the [] 
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;ls h[io].txt&quot; will list every file in the cwd that 
                starts with an 'h', has either an 'i' or an 'o', then ends with 
                a &quot;.txt&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
