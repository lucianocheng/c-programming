<h2>Pointers, Addresses, and Arrays:</h2>
<ul>
<li>In C, you are given free range to (attempt to) <span>access (read or write) </span>any memory address you can imagine.
<ul>
<li>&quot;With great power, comes great responsibility&quot; - Spiderman</li>
<li>Remember, the program is only as smart <span>and safe</span> as the programmer. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Addresses: </strong>
<ul>
<li>At the machine level, the memory the program runs in is accessed by <strong>address numbers</strong></li>
<li>The address of any variable can be retrieved using the &amp; operator:
  <pre>int x = 5;
printf(&quot;The address %d halds the value %d in it\n&quot;, &amp;x, x); // address as int which may be negative
printf(&quot;The address %u halds the value %d in it\n&quot;, &amp;x, x); // address as unsigned (positive) int
printf(&quot;The address %x holds the value %d in it\n&quot;, &amp;x, x); // address in hex (base 16) </pre>
  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pointers:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A C pointer is a variable designed to <strong>hold a memory address of a particular data type. </strong></li>
        <li>We say that a pointer <em>points to</em> an
          address in memory (whereas C arrays <em><strong>are </strong></em>addresses in memory)</li>
        <li>Pointers are declared using the * operator and the data type you want to point to, e.g.:
          <pre>char *x; // x is a pointer to char; its type is char *
int *y; // y is a pointer to int; its type is int * </pre>
      </li>
        <li>Pointers can be assigned values just like any other variable, except they hold addresses:
          <pre> char *myPointer;
 char myChar = &#39;a&#39;;
 myPointer = &amp;myChar;            </pre>
      </li>
        <li>Pointers are <strong>dereferenced</strong> with the * operator <span>(and in some cases with the [] operator, discussed below)</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Dereferencing means &quot;getting the value <strong>at</strong> the address I am pointing to&quot;</li>
          <li>The * operator takes the address stored in the pointer, and gets the value at that address. Example:
            <pre>char *myPointer;
char myChar = &#39;b&#39;;
myPointer = &amp;myChar;
printf(&quot;myPointer dereferenced is %c\n&quot;, *myPointer); // prints &quot;myPointer dereferenced is b&quot;
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>You can also use <span> the dereference operator to assign a value to a pointer </span>
            <pre>char a;
char *myPointer = &amp;a;
*myPointer = &#39;b&#39;; </pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>C pointers <em><strong>point </strong></em>to an address in memory (whereas C arrays <em><strong>are </strong></em>addresses in memory)
          
          <ul>
            <li>For engineering purposes, and to distinguish address values from other values, we typically use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexidecimal" target="_blank">hexadecimal</a> (base 16) values when expressing addresses</li>
            <li>In
              C, hexadecimal values are expressed with a &#39;0x&#39; in front. So the
              hexadecimal value of 1, expressed in 32 bits, is 0x00000001. Each digit
              represents 4 bits (16 possibilities), with values <span>0-9 and A-F</span></li>
          </ul>
      <li>Pointer arithmetic
            <ul>
              <li>You can do calculatons (&quot;pointer arithmetic&quot;) with pointers, typically to walk them through arrays.
                <ul>
                  <li>You can use an array to calculate an address:<br>
                  <pre>char my_array[3];
char* my_pointer;
my_pointer = my_array + 3;</pre>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>BUT, You CAN NOT do pointer arithmatic that changes the address of an array</strong><br>
                  <pre>char my_array[3];
my_array = my_array + 3; // This will fail; you cannot change the address of an array EVER!</pre>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>A pointer to <span>data type T is incremented by the number of bytes in T</span>
                <ul>
                  <li>For example, the following code would increment myPointer by <span>the number of bytes in an int (machine dependent).<br>
                  </span>int a[3] = {0, 1, 2};
int *myPointer = a;
myPointer++;
printf(&quot;myPointer dereferenced is %d\n&quot;, *myPointer); // prints &quot;myPointer dereferenced is 1&quot;              </pre>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Other valid operations:<br>
              <pre>   myPointer--;
   myPointer + 1;
   myPointer + i;           </pre>
              </li>
              <li>Can be used to loop through arrays:
                <ul>
                  <li>Example of an array traversed with pointer notation<br>
                    <pre>char word[] = &quot;hello&quot;<br>
char *p;
for(p = word; *p != &#39;\0&#39;; p++){
   printf(&quot;%c&quot;, *p);
} </pre>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
      </li>
        <li>Pointers and the [] operator. <br>
          <ul>
            <li><span>The
            [] operator may be used in conjuction with a pointer. </span></li>
            <li><span>This works
            if the pointer is pointing to </span>
              <ul>
                <li><span>an array</span></li>
                <li><span>a sequence of data
                  items in contiguous memory, that all have the same type. </span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span>For a pointer p to type T, the
              expression p[num] accesses the value at address (p + num*(sizeof T in
              bytes)) </span>            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>myPointer[3] is equivalent to *(myPointer + 3)
          <pre>int intArray[5] = {0, 5, 10, 15, 20};
int *myPointer;
myPointer = intArray;
printf(&quot;(myPointer+3) dereferenced is %d\n&quot;, myPointer[3]); // prints &quot;(myPointer + 3) dereferenced is 15&quot;</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
        <li>Pointers with functions
          <ul>
            <li>A pointer can be passed to a function as an argument. </li>
            <li>A function can then use the pointer to change the value <strong>at the address the pointer has stored</strong>.
              <ul>
                <li>The following example would modify the variable &#39;myChar&#39; inside main():
                  <pre>int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
   char myChar;
   foo(&amp;myChar);
} 
                      
void foo(char* myCharPointer){
   *myCharPointer = &#39;a&#39;;
}               </pre>
                </li>
                <li>As demonstrated above, typically the &amp; operator and functions with pointer arguments are used to <em>mimic </em>passing values by reference, <strong>by passing pointers by value</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Functions can also return pointers
              <ul>
                <li>The following function returns a pointer to the second element in an array:<br>
                  <pre>char* foo(char* myArray){
   return myArray+1;
}</pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Don&#39;t return pointers to local variables declared within the function! They &quot;disappear&quot; when the function exits! </strong> 
                  <ul>
                    <li><span>Local
                      variables are stored on the stack</span></li>
                    <li><span>O</span><span>nce a function returns, the local
                      variables are no longer valid. </span></li>
                    <li><span>Moreover, the area on the stack where
                      they were stored may be overwritten by stack frames for subsequent
                      function calls.</span></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
        <li>Pointers to NULL:
          <ul>
            <li>Typically, if we don&#39;t want the pointer pointing out into never-never land, we set the pointer equal to NULL.
              <ul>
                <li><span>NULL is</span> #defined in stdlib.h and stdio.h to be &#39;\0&#39;</li>
                <li>NULL
                  is of value 0x00000000, no variable in our program will ever get
                  allocated at this address, so a pointer will only point there if we
                  explicitly tell it to.</li>
                <li>We can then compare our pointer to NULL:<br>
                <pre>if(myPointer == NULL) { do something }</pre> </li>
                <li>Pointers can also be compared to one another, to see if they point to the same thing:<br>
                  <pre>if(myPointer == yourPointer) printf(&quot;We&#39;re pointing to the same thing!\n&quot;);</pre>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
        <li>Overloading:
          <ul>
            <li>The * operator is overloaded; it can mean a number of different things based on the context
              <ul>
                <li>Multiplication:<br>
                <pre>int a = 8 * 5; </pre>
                </li>
                <li>Pointer Declaration<br> 
                <pre>char *a; </pre>
                </li>
                <li>Pointer Dereferencing<br>
                <pre>*a = &#39;c&#39;; // where a is a pointer to a char</pre>
                </li>
                <li>All of these uses are <strong>completely different</strong>, they just all happen to use the same character. <strong>Do not confuse them</strong>. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
        <li>sizeof()
          <ul>
            <li>sizeof() returns the size of a datatype in bytes
              <ul>
                <li>sizeof(int) will return 4 on a 32 bit machine (where the size of an int is 4 bytes), </li>
                <li>sizeof(int) would return 2 on a 16 bit machine, 8 on a 64 bit machine..</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The size of a struct is machine and compiler dependent.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </li>
<li><strong>Arrays: </strong>
<ul>
<li>C arrays are <strong>contiguous blocks of memory, </strong>where the array name <strong>is the address of the beginning of the block</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Allocating an array of ten chars called temp, starting at memory space 0x00000050 would: </span><ul><li><span>occupy addresses 0x00000050 to 0x00000059 (assuming (sizeof char) is 1)</span><span></span>
</li>
<li><span>cause the value of temp to be 0x00000050 </span></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arrays are declared <strong>using the []</strong> notation and the name of the element datatype
<ul>
<li>The Code <span>char hello[5]</span>;
  <ul>
<li>Allocates 5x(the byte size of char) memory spaces</li>
<li>Points &#39;hello&#39; to the first space </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The &amp; operator can be used in conjunction with the [] operator, to return an address at a offset:
<ul>
<li><span>&amp;hello[2]</span> will return the address at hello offset by 2</li>
<li> Same thing as <span>hello + 2 </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A array name in C <strong>is</strong> <strong>similar but not exactly the same as</strong> a pointer in C.

<ul>
<li>In particular, Arrays automatically allocate space, but can&#39;t be relocated.</li>
<li>Eg, the following would be <strong>invalid</strong>:<br>
  <pre>   char a[50] = &quot;hello&quot;;
   a++;
</pre>
</li>
<li>For more information about the differences between pointers and array names, read <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/c-faq/c-2.html" target="_blank">this fantastic FAQ </a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Array names point to <strong>the first address</strong> in a set of contiguous memory addresses, pointers point to <strong>a memory address</strong>...
<ul>
<li>Therefore, <strong>a pointer can be assigned to the address the first element in an array</strong>, or any element if you use pointer arithmetic
  <pre>char* myPointer;
char[50] myString = &quot;hello&quot;;
myPointer = myString;</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>2D arrays</strong> can be declared and accessed using 2 sets of []&#39;s:<br>
  <pre>    int myMatrix[4][4];
    myMatrix[0][0] = 1;</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strings, string.h and NULL termination:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:
</strong>
<ul>
<li>A string in C is a <strong>NULL terminated</strong> sequence of characters
<ul>
<li>
  NULL is represented as &#39;\0&#39;, ASCII number 0, or &#39;NULL&#39; which is #defined in stdio.h
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In C, strings are stored in arrays of chars</li>
<li>If a character array is to hold a string, it must be at least of size (string length + 1) to handle the NULL character at the end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Declaring a string:
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
  If you use the double quotes when you declare, C will NULL terminate the declared string automatically. Otherwise, you must do it yourself.
  <pre>
   char myString[80] = &quot;I am a string yay!&quot;;
   char myString[] = &quot;I am a string yay!&quot;;
   char myString[] = {&#39;I&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;m&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;n&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;!&#39;, &#39;\0&#39;};</pre>
</li>
<li>Using the * method of string declaration will declare allocate the string in the static / stoic data area.
<ul>
<li>It will not get reallocated every time the function is called.</li>
<li>The string values cannot be changed:
  <pre>char *myString = &quot;I am a unchangeable string yay!&quot;;</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Constructing a string from chars:
</strong>
<ul>
<li>A string is just a sequence of chars that is NULL terminated
<ul>
<li> You can construct a string from chars by storing them correctly in a char array </li>
<li>You must remember to NULL terminate!<br>
<pre>
  char myString[5];
  myString[0] = &#39;H&#39;;
  myString[1] = &#39;i&#39;;
  myString[2] = &#39;\0&#39;;
</pre>  
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any data stored after the NULL in the string is in the array, but not considered part of the string.
<ul>
<li>For C strings, the &#39;\0&#39; is where the sidewalk ends </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other useful chars / #defines:
  <ul>
<li>&#39;\n&#39; is a newline</li>
<li>&#39;\t&#39; is a tab</li>
<li>EOF means End of File, which is #define'd as -1</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>string.h library: </strong>
<ul>
<li>string.h is a library filled with useful functions that operate on strings.</li>
<li>All functions in string.h require NULL terminated string parameters.
<ul>
<li>Non NULL-terminated parameters will cause the function to run off the edge of the array looking for the NULL, causing <strong>segmentation faults</strong></li>
<li>You must pass the string.h functions <strong>a character array or a pointer to a character array
</strong>
<ul>
<li>You cannot pass a char ... it will crash</li>

<li>You <strong>cannot pass NULL</strong> ... it will crash</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You cannot use the &#39;==&#39; operator when comparing strings
<ul>
<li>The &#39;==&#39; compares the addresses of the arrays / pointers, not their contents</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Functions that we expect you to know, code, and debug:</strong>
<ul>
<li>strlen()
<ul>
<li>
Format: <strong>int strlen(char* str)</strong>
<pre>
int result = 0;
char test[10] = &quot;hello&quot;;
result = strlen(test); </pre>
</li>

<li>Returns the length of the string</li>
<li>Does not include the NULL character in the length</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>strcmp()
<ul>
<li>Format: <strong>int strcmp(char* str1, char* str2)</strong>
  <pre>int result = 0;
char test1[10] = &quot;hello&quot;;
result = strcmp(test1, &quot;goodbye&quot;);</pre>
</li>
<li>Returns 0 if the strings are equal</li>
<li>Returns &gt; 0 if first non-matching char in str1 &gt; first non-matching char in str2
<ul>
<li>Meaning, returns &gt; 0 if str1 &gt; str2 in ASCII order</li>

<li><strong>Meaning, returns &gt; 0 if str2 is alphanumerically before str1</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Otherwise, returns &lt; 0 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>strncmp()
<ul>
<li>Format: <strong>int strncmp(char* str1, char* str2, size_t num);</strong><br>
  <pre>int result = 0;
char test1[10] = &quot;good&quot;;
result = strcmp(test1, &quot;goodbye&quot;, 4);</pre>
</li>
<li>Same as strcmp, except only compares it for the first n characters </li>
<li>size_t is the same as unsigned int</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>strcpy()

<ul>
<li>Format: <strong>char* strcpy(char* dest, char* src); </strong><br>
  <pre>
char source[10] = &quot;mytest&quot;;
char destination[10];
char* ptr_to_dest;
ptr_to_dest = strcpy(destination, source);</pre>
</li>
<li>Returns dest</li>
<li>Copies the string in src to dest.</li>

<li>dest must be large enough to hold the string in src + the NULL </li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Structs</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Structs are the grandfather of Java Objects
<ul>
<li><strong>Similarities</strong> with Java Objects:
<ul>
<li>Structs are first declared, then used to create instances. Similarly, Classes are first declared, then used to create objects.</li>
<li>Sructs can have member variables.</li>

<li>Structs exhibit variable scope so that you can access and modify their member variables.
<ul>
<li>Like in Java, the &quot;.&quot; operator is used to change scope</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Structs can have other structs as member variables.</li>
<li>Structs can include arrays as member variables</li>
<li>You can create arrays of structs</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Differences</strong> with Java Objects:
<ul>
<li>Structs have <strong>no member functions whatsoever</strong>, including constructors, accessors, and modifiers. You cannot, for example, write a member function called &quot;bendGurder()&quot; for a struct type called Robot and call &quot;myRobot.bendGurder()&quot;.
<ul>
<li> Function pointers (which we will discuss later) can mimic member functions in some ways, but do not have the same functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All variables in a struct are public, while Java classes can have private members.
<ul>
<li>structs have no inherit encapsulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Struct member variables cannot have initial values; the initial values of member variables will be whatever garbage happens to be in memory.
<ul>
<li><strong>You must assign values to struct member variables before using them</strong>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The entire contents of a struct can be coped to another struct using the &quot;=&quot; operator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basically, create your own variable by combining other variables </li>
<li>Stucts can have arrays of variables in them
<ul>
<li>They can have character arrays, which means they can hold strings </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Declaration</strong>:
<ul>

<li>We use typedef to simplify our struct declaration.
<ul>
<li>Otherwise, we&#39;d have to write &quot;struct &lt;struct name&gt; &lt;instance name&gt;&quot; every time we declared a new instance of our struct</li>
<li>A typedef is similar to a #define, except it happens in the compiler rather than the preprocessor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
 Definition Format (in .h file):
 
 <pre>
 typedef struct{ 
    int age; 
    char firstName[80]; 
    char lastName[80]; 
    double gpa; 
 } Student;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Instance declaration syntax:
<ul>
<li>Just like a normal variable<br>
  <pre>Student myStudent;</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Assignment</strong>
<ul>
<li>A entire struct can be set equal to the values of another struct that is the same type
  <pre>Student lukeStudent;
Student alexStudent;
lukeStudent = alexStudent;
</pre>
  <span></span></li>
<li>Comparison operators do not work on structs
<ul>
<li>==, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, etc, are <strong>not valid</strong> for structs </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Member variables are accessed using the &quot;.&quot; operator
<ul>
<li>Once you access the variable using the &quot;.&quot; operator, can be treated just like a variable of that type.
<ul>
<li>ints can be added to / increased, etc</li>
<li>char arrays can hold strings, and be passed to string.h functions</li>
<li>arrays can be accessed using the [] operator</li>

<li>pointers can move, etc</li>
<li>Example (data may be altered from reality):
<pre>Student lukeStudent;
lukeStudent.gpa = 4.0;
lukeStudent.age = 22;
strcpy(lukeStudent.firstName, &quot;Love&quot;);
strcpy(lukeStudent.lastName, &quot;Machine&quot;);
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Memory / Stack Model</h2>
<ul>

<li> C gives you free access to memory, whereas Java tends to keep you in
a safe sandbox. However, with great power comes great responsibility:
<ul>
<li> In C, you are free to access the address of any variable using the
&amp; operator. This includes system space and other things you should
not be accessing.</li>
<li><strong>You must be careful in writing your code to
  make sure your memory accesses are accurate, there is no throwing of
  exceptions in C.</strong> </li>
<li><strong>C is not type safe:</strong> The C compiler will allow
you to assign any other variable to any other variable, no matter
the type, with little more than a warning. It assumes you know what
you are doing. You must be careful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dynamic variables are created using the malloc() operator, like the
&quot;new&quot; operator in Java</li>
<li>Memory is freed with the &quot;free()&quot; function. In Java this
is handled automatically</li>
<li> When a C program is first started, through the magic of Virtual Memory,
the OS gives the program a contiguous address space on which to run. </li>
<li> The DATA is initially stored in the memory space. This contains all
the information relating to the instructions in the functions, and the
amount of memory each function requires on the stack</li>

<li> The HEAP grows downward. The heap contains all the memory you allocate
using the malloc() call</li>
<li>The STACK grows upward. The stack contains all the memory you allocate
with your function calls.</li>
