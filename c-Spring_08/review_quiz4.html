<h2>Structs</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Definition</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Structs are <strong>custom C data types</strong>, created by grouping together a bunch of other data types.
        <ul>
          <li>... useful because not all programs are easily described in by chars, ints, and doubles.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Structs are the grandfather of Java Objects
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Similarities</strong> with Java Objects:
            <ul>
              <li>Structs are first declared, then used to create instances. Similarly, Classes are first declared, then used to create objects.</li>
              <li>Sructs can have member variables.</li>
              <li>Structs exhibit variable scope so that you can access and modify their member variables.
                <ul>
                  <li>Like in Java, the &quot;.&quot; operator is used to change scope</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Structs can have other structs as member variables.</li>
              <li>Structs can include arrays as member variables</li>
              <li>You can create arrays of structs</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Differences</strong> with Java Objects:
            <ul>
              <li>Structs have <strong>no member functions whatsoever</strong>, including constructors, accessors, and modifiers. You cannot, for example, write a member function called &quot;bendGurder()&quot; for a struct type called Robot and call &quot;myRobot.bendGurder()&quot;.
                <ul>
                  <li> Function pointers (which we will discuss later) can mimic member functions in some ways, but do not have the same functionality.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>All variables in a struct are public, while Java classes can have private members.
                <ul>
                    <li>structs have no inherit encapsulation.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Struct member variables cannot have initial values; the initial values of member variables will be whatever garbage happens to be in memory.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>You must assign values to struct member variables before using them</strong>. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>The entire contents of a struct can be coped to another struct using the &quot;=&quot; operator.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Basically, create your own variable by combining other variables </li>
      <li>Stucts can have arrays of variables in them
        <ul>
          <li>They can have character arrays, which means they can hold strings <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>    Declaration</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li>We use typedef to simplify our struct declaration.
          <ul>
              <li>Otherwise, we&#39;d have to write &quot;struct &lt;struct name&gt; &lt;instance name&gt;&quot; every time we declared a new instance of our struct</li>
            <li>A typedef is similar to a #define, except it happens in the compiler rather than the preprocessor</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      <li> Definition Format (in .h file):
        <pre>
 typedef struct{ 
    int age; 
    char firstName[80]; 
    char lastName[80]; 
    double gpa; 
 } Student;
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Instance declaration syntax:
        <ul>
              <li>Just like a normal variable<br>
                  <pre>Student myStudent;</pre>
              </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Assignment</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>A entire struct can be set equal to the values of another struct that is the same type
          <pre>Student lukeStudent;
Student alexStudent;
lukeStudent = alexStudent;
</pre>
            <span></span></li>
        <li>Comparison operators do not work on structs
          <ul>
              <li>==, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, etc, are <strong>not valid</strong> for structs </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Member variables are accessed using the &quot;.&quot; operator
          <ul>
              <li>Once you access the variable using the &quot;.&quot; operator, can be treated just like a variable of that type.
                <ul>
                    <li>ints can be added to / increased, etc</li>
                  <li>char arrays can hold strings, and be passed to string.h functions</li>
                  <li>arrays can be accessed using the [] operator</li>
                  <li>pointers can move, etc</li>
                  <li>Example (data may be altered from reality):
                    <pre>Student lukeStudent;
lukeStudent.gpa = 4.0;
lukeStudent.age = 22;
strcpy(lukeStudent.firstName, &quot;Love&quot;);
strcpy(lukeStudent.lastName, &quot;Machine&quot;); </pre>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1xx/projects/CandC++/Structs/GettingStarted/" target="_blank">The Struct Tutorial</a> for a complete review </li>
</ul>
<h2>Struct Pointers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Pointers are variables that hold the addresses (locations) of other variables
<pre>
int* my_pointer;
int my_variable;
my_pointer = &amp;my_variable // point my_pointer to my_variable</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Struct pointers are created the same way

    <pre>typedef struct{      
    int age;
    double gpa;   
} Student;


Student my_student;
Student* my_student_ptr;


my_student.age = 21;
my_student.gpa = 3.9;
my_student_ptr = &amp;my_student;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>However structs have multiple elements in they
    <ul>
      <li> They require another level of access</li>
      <li> Dereferencing a struct pointer will get you the struct itself, but not the variables inside it.
        <pre>
Student my_student;
Student my_student_copy; 
Student* ptr;


// Give my_student values
my_student.age = 21;
my_student.gpa = 3.9;


// Point ptr to my_student
ptr = &amp;my_student;

// Copy my_student using ptr
my_student_copy = *ptr;        </pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In order to get the variables inside the struct from a pointer, you have to use the . operator with it
            <pre>
Student my_student;
Student* ptr;
int orig_age;


// Give my_student values
my_student.age = 21;
my_student.gpa = 3.9;


// Point ptr to my_student
ptr = &amp;my_student;

// Get the age from my_student using ptr
orig_age = (*ptr).age;

// Set a new age
(*ptr).age = 22;     </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            However the above operation is so obnoxious and so common, the designers of C created a shortcut for it
            <pre> orig_age = ptr->age; //means the same as orig_age = (*ptr).age;
 ptr->age = 22;       //means the same as (*ptr).age = 22;
</pre>
          </li>
          <li> The "->" operator is a shortcut for the <strong>combined use of '*' and '.'<br>
            </strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
      <li> Using standard pointer notation, and the -> operator, you can easily pull data out of an array of structs
        <pre>
// Example taken from the slides
#include “person.h”   // Assume Person and MAX_DATA are defined here 

int main() { 
    Person data[MAX_DATA]; 
    Person *p;    
   
    // Assume array gets filled with data 
    int i = 0; 
    for (p = data; i < MAX_DATA; i++, p++) 
       printf(“name: %c, id: %d\n”, p->name, p->id); 
}       </pre>
      </li>
  <li>
Finally, you can use functions, combined with struct pointers, to modify structs using pointers
<pre>
// Example taken from the slides
#include “person.h”   // Assume Person is defined here 

int main() { 
    
    // Here we declare and intialize one struct person 
    Person person1 = {‘a’, 25};   
    process(&person1);        
    printf(“name is %c, id is %d\n”, person1.name, person2.id);  // What is printed? 
}


void process(Person * p){ 
    p->id = 500; 
}</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bitwise Operators</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is more than one way of representing a number
    <ul>
      <li>A decimal
        <ul>
          <li>Eg, 998</li>
          <li>As humans we like this because is base 10 and we have 10 fingers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Binary
        <ul>
          <li>Eg, 0000100</li>
          <li>Computers use this, so would we if we only had 2 fingers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Hexidecimal
        <ul>
          <li>Eg, F2</li>
          <li>In C, literal hex values are always prepended with a '0x', so above would be 0xF2</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At the most basic level, all values in C are stored as a collection of bits
    <ul>
      <li>In gcc, char is 8 bits (1 byte), an int is 32 bits (4 bytes), etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Currently, we have tons of operations to manipulate the entire value
    <ul>
      <li>+, -, /, %, *, =, etc</li>
      <li>But none of these allow us to fiddle with the individual bits in a value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In order to manipulate values at the bit level, we need a new set of operators, <strong>bitwise operators</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Bitwise operators ignore datatypes (char, int, etc), and treat all values as bit collections
        <ul>
          <li>&amp; - Bitwise AND</li>
          <li>| - Bitwise OR</li>
          <li>^ - Bitwise XOR (Exclusive Or)</li>
          <li>~ - Bitwise NOT</li>
          <li>&lt;&lt; - Bitwise SHIFT LEFT</li>
          <li>&gt;&gt; - Bitwise SHIFT RIGHT</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bit Masks
    <ul>
      <li>Used to toggle the individual bits in a C variable</li>
      <li>
        Eg, 01110000 to 01010000, and back
         <pre>#define READY 1    // Binary 0000 0000 0000 0001
#define WAITING 2  // Binary 0000 0000 0000 0010
#define RUNNING 4  // Binary 0000 0000 0000 0100


int status;


// Turn status&rsquo; READY bit on (leaving other bits unchanged) 
status = status | READY;


// Toggle the READY bit. 
// If it&rsquo;s on, turn it off. If it&rsquo;s off, turn it on.
status = status ^ READY;

// Clear all bits except the READY bit; leave READY bit unchanged. 
status = status &amp; READY;</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  Bit Shifting
    <ul>
      <li>Shift bits to the left or to the right within the variable
        <ul>
          <li>When left shifting, empty space is filled with a 0</li>
          <li>When right shifting, empty space is filled with whatever value was just there</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Format is
        <ul>
          <li>Left Shift: (variable to shift) &lt;&lt; (number of shifts to make)</li>
          <li>Right Shift: (variable to shift) &gt;&gt; (number of shifts to make)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Example:
        <ul>
          <li>8 &gt;&gt; 1 // This would equal 4
            <ul>
              <li>8 in binary is 0000 0000 0000 0100</li>
              <li>The above binary value, right shifted one time, is 0000 0000 0000 0010</li>
              <li>The new binary value represents 4, in decimal</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Malloc</h2>
<ul>

<li>In the past, we have focused on using heap memory
  <ul>
    <li>Heap memory is filled with function calls</li>
    <li>In heap memory, you cannot allocate a block of memory based on a variable size:
      <ul>
        <li>Eg, the following is invalid<br>
        int my_array[x];</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>To get around this, we use heap memory (see below) that is dynamically allocated
  <ul>
    <li>IE, allocated on-the-fly specifically by you, of any size that doesn't exceed the computer's memory capacity</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>In C, dynamic memory is allocated by malloc, or some function that calls malloc()
  <ul>
    <li>When you call malloc(), it takes the value you pass it, and allocates that many bytes on the heap</li>
    <li>It then returns to you a pointer that points to this newly allocated memory
      <ul>
        <li>The returned pointer is type void*, aka a pointer that is not associated with a particular data type</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      This memory stays until you free it, it does not dissappear when the function ends.
<pre>
char* my_mem;
my_mem = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char) * 70);
free(my_mem);
</pre>
<li>
The sizeof() function is a system call that returns the width, in bytes, of a datatype</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Memory / Stack Model</h2>
<ul>

<li> C gives you free access to memory, whereas Java tends to keep you in
a safe sandbox. However, with great power comes great responsibility:
<ul>
<li> In C, you are free to access the address of any variable using the
&amp; operator. This includes system space and other things you should
not be accessing.</li>
<li><strong>You must be careful in writing your code to
  make sure your memory accesses are accurate, there is no throwing of
  exceptions in C.</strong> </li>
<li><strong>C is not type safe:</strong> The C compiler will allow
you to assign any other variable to any other variable, no matter
the type, with little more than a warning. It assumes you know what
you are doing. You must be careful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dynamic variables are created using the malloc() operator, like the
&quot;new&quot; operator in Java</li>
<li>Memory is freed with the &quot;free()&quot; function. In Java this
is handled automatically</li>
<li> When a C program is first started, through the magic of Virtual Memory,
the OS gives the program a contiguous address space on which to run. </li>
<li> The DATA is initially stored in the memory space. This contains all
the information relating to the instructions in the functions, and the
amount of memory each function requires on the stack</li>

<li> The HEAP grows downward. The heap contains all the memory you allocate
using the malloc() call</li>
<li>The STACK grows upward. The stack contains all the memory you allocate
with your function calls.</li>
