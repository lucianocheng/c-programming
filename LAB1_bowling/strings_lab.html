<h1>ESE 113/116 Lab: String Exercise</h1>
<p>The purpose of this lab is to create a simple program that parses input from 
  STDIN, breaks up the input into words, deletes repeated words, and prints out 
  the words and their sizes to STDOUT</p>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Writing a program to read from STDIN and write to STDOUT</li>
  <li>Using strlen, strcmp, strcpy from the string library, as well as constructing 
    strings from characters</li>
  <li>Using getchar(), a simple function that reads one byte (one character) from 
    STDIN at a time</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reference:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./strings.html">C Strings: Background</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/getchar.html">getchar() 
    man page</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdin">Standard Streams in Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Exercise: String Data Printer</h2>
<p><em>Please read the <a href="./strings.html">C Strings: Background</a> page 
  before starting this exercise. Unless you fully grasp the concepts presented 
  in the background page, this exercise cannot be completed correctly.</em></p>
<p>Download and complete <a href="strings.c">strings.c</a>. Extended instructions 
  for completion are included in comments in the file. Once completed, this program 
  will read a stream from STDIN, break up the stream into words, delete repeated 
  words, and print out the words and their sizes to stdout.</p>
<p>Specific sections of code have been left blank for you to fill in. See the 
  instructions in the file.</p>
<p>For reading from STDIN it is sufficient to use only getchar() and not scanf.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The purpose of the getWord() function is to write 
  a single word from STDIN to newString. The word should have no spaces or newlines 
  preceeding it or following it. Please keep this overarching purpose in mind 
  when constructing your code.</strong></font></p>
<p>An example run and interaction might look like this:</p>
<code class="block"></code>
<pre>$ ./strings
hello
'hello', size: 5
hello
goodbye
'goodbye', size: 7
fox
'fox', size: 3 
</pre>
<p>To facilitate testing, a text file <a href="./test.txt">test.txt</a> has been 
  provided that covers all of the corner cases. To run your strings program with 
  the test.txt file, you must redirect the test.txt file into the program. You 
  do this with the '&lt;' on the command line:</p>
<p>./strings &lt; test.txt</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">COMMON POINT OF CONFUSION: The getWord() function 
  should always return 1 as long as a word was found. GetWord() should return 
  0 if and only if getchar() returned EOF and NO WORD WAS FOUND BEFOREHAND.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>In other words, if a word was found, and the 
  word was immediately followed with an EOF, getWord() should still return 1. 
  The NEXT call to getWord() will then return 0.</strong></font></p>
